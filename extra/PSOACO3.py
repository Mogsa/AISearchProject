# Assumptions about the skeleton:
#   • `num_cities`  – integer, number of cities (already parsed for us)
#   • `dist_matrix` – 2‑D list [num_cities][num_cities] of symmetric distances
#   •  We must finally assign **tour**   – a permutation of 0..num_cities‑1
#                     and **tour_length** – its total length (int or float)
#   •  Variables `max_it`, `num_ants`, `num_parts` should be set if we want
#      them recorded in the generated TOUR file.

############ YOUR CODE SHOULD NOW BE COMPLETE AND WHEN EXECUTION OF THIS PROGRAM 'skeleton.py'
############ REACHES THIS POINT, YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPUTED A TOUR IN THE RESERVED LIST VARIABLE 'tour', 
############ WHICH HOLDS A LIST OF THE INTEGERS FROM {0, 1, ..., 'num_cities' - 1} SO THAT EVERY INTEGER
############ APPEARS EXACTLY ONCE, AND YOU SHOULD ALSO HOLD THE LENGTH OF THIS TOUR IN THE RESERVED
############ INTEGER VARIABLE 'tour_length'.
############
############ YOUR TOUR WILL BE PACKAGED IN A TOUR FILE OF THE APPROPRIATE FORMAT AND THIS TOUR FILE'S
############ NAME WILL BE A MIX OF THE NAME OF THE CITY FILE, THE NAME OF THIS PROGRAM AND THE
############ CURRENT DATE AND TIME. SO, EVERY SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION GIVES A TOUR FILE WITH A UNIQUE
