NOTE = Enhanced ACO-TSP solver with 2-opt local search and adaptive parameters. Uses nearest neighbor initialization, candidate lists, and MAX-MIN AS with diversification strategies to avoid local minima.
The parameter values are 'max_it' = 40 and 'num_parts' = 15.
RUN-TIME = 195.6 seconds.
DATE-TIME = 21/04/2025-17:33:51.
CERTIFICATE = 13176.
