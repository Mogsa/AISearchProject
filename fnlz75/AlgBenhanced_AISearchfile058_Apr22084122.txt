NOTE = Highly-optimized ACO-PSO Hybrid with anti-stagnation strategies and advanced performance optimizations. Base PSO Params: theta=0.75, alpha=1.5, beta=1.5, delta=2. ACO Params: rho=0.1, q=100.0, init_ph=0.1. Runtime optimizations: Nearest-neighbor warm starting, cached pheromone biased targets, delta-evaluation in 2-opt, pre-generated random values, batch processing of particles, early stopping criteria, lookup tables for expensive operations, dynamic resource allocation based on problem size, selective operation skipping for non-improved states, and in-place operations. Algorithm enhancements: Multi-swarm with diversified parameters, adaptive 2-opt local search, optimized simulated annealing acceptance, intelligent particle resetting, stagnation detection, adaptive parameter control, and information exchange between swarms.
The parameter values are 'max_it' = 1000 and 'num_parts' = 290.
